-Used JS to set up a grid and add event listeners for mouseover to color grid squares black by default (possibly change to only while mouse clicked down later)
-Allow grid to be reset to user selected size
-have option for each pass over grid square to be a random color implemented two ways, one with an array another utilizing a script from "github.com/davidmerfield/randomColor".
-next steps are to add support for shading grid squares darker with each pass and allowing the user to pick a color.
