# Etch-a-Sketch
Etch-a-Sketch app from Odin Project curriculum (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project?ref=lnav)

##### 9/10/19
- Used JS to set up a grid and add event listeners for mouseover to color grid squares black by default (possibly change to only while mouse clicked down later)
- Allow grid to be reset to user selected size
- have option for each pass over grid square to be a random color implemented two ways, one with an array another utilizing a script from "github.com/davidmerfield/randomColor".
- next steps are to add support for shading grid squares darker with each pass and allowing the user to pick a color.

##### 9/11/19
- Added greyscale functionality through Shading button (using "opacity" style attribute)
- Removed reset button and instead prompt for a new grid when new color option button is clicked
- Removed button to pick a specific color, may add in later but doesn't seem necessary for now.
